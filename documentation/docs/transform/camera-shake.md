A replacement for Nuke's default camera shake node -- offers more control over 3 different frequencies of camera shake, and also shakes the centre-point, giving more detail to sub-frame motionblur. Also has options for how to deal with edge-of-frame pixels, so pushing in isn't always your best option anymore!
