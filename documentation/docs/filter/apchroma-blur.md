# apChromaBlur AP

**Author:** Adrian Pueyo - [http://www.adrianpueyo.com/](http://www.adrianpueyo.com/)

This tool allows you to blur or defocus red, green, and blue channels separately, and for all Layers (channels) in the stream.

Each knob can be broken up to r, g, b channels and individually manipulated.

To be used with the apChroma multi-channel alpha workflow so that apChromaMerge can be used.
