Nuke Survival Toolkit Menu Bar: Nukepedia Menu Bar","title":"Menus"},{"location":"techSpecs.html","text":"Technical Details There are a few things about this menu that try and make it both easy and safe to use. In the main folder there is a menu.py file that is used to add 5 relative plugin paths. These are the following folders: ./gizmos - for all NST gizmo files ./nk_files - for all NST .nk scripts ./python - 1 helper file, and a handful of tool-specific python files ./icons - for all tool icons ./images - for all image files required for some tools/examples IMPORTANT: This has changed from the v1.1.1 version of the NST to be relative paths. There were some network startup slowdowns happening from nuke recursively adding many pluginPaths in the previous init.py. Removing all the folders and narrowing it down to just 5 seemed to speed up start up time while keeping the menu looking the same. Also adding the plugin paths in the menu instead of the init made sure that there was not unnecessary load time happening for renderfarms or command-line nuke sessions where the GUI and menu is not needed. The menu.py in the main folder is primarily building almost the entire toolkit menu. You will find it organized into sections: Draw, Time, Color, Filter , etc. The tools will show up in the order that you designate them in this menu. Nuke does not like to load multiple gizmo files with the same name. Because the Nuke Survival Toolkit may be added into company pipelines that already have many gizmo\u2019s being loaded in, I have given all .gizmo files their own prefix \u201cNST_\u201d . This means all files should have a unique name to any file that would be already installed. For example, if there was an iBlur.gizmo installed, the one in Nuke Survival Toolkit is named NST_iBlur.gizmo , so there should be no conflicts. In the main menu.py at the top, there is a variable that you can replace if you choose to find/replace the \"NST_\" prefix to a custom one for all the gizmos. You could do this with a renaming software or via the terminal for all gizmos with the \"NST_\" prefix. If you change \"NST_\" to \"WOW_\" for example, just enter \"WOW_\" in this variable. This might help if two different Nuke Survival Toolkits are being loaded at once, to keep them unique. All gizmo\u2019s are stored as .gizmo files on the folder system, but are all actually loaded into nuke as Groups, with no link back to the gizmo filepath. This is a strange bug / feature / work around that sort of tricks nuke into thinking you have loaded a gizmo, but actually have loaded a group. There are a few advantages to this method: Nuke will automatically open the properties panel of the tool, unlike if you nuke.nodePaste() a .nk file Nuke actually stores the defaults of the gizmo in memory, during that specific nuke session. This means you will be able to ctrl + right click on knobs and reset them to their intended default settings. This unfortunately goes away once you close and re-open the script, as nuke will just consider the nodes a normal group and will not know what the defaults are. Groups are generally easier to debug and enter inside to see what is going on. This will help with render farms or other users opening scripts that would normally be sourcing the gizmos from wherever you have placed the Nuke Survival Toolkit. Sometimes render farms or other users cannot access your local directories, which might cause errors when other artists or render farms are trying to open the script, since they may not be loading the NukeSurvivalToolkit. Making sure the tools are Groups will mean the tools exist in your nuke script and will never be unlinked/unsourced when someone else is opening the nuke script. If you prefer to use gizmos instead of groups, you simply have to open the gizmo in a text editor and change where it says \"Group\" at the top of each .gizmo file, and replace it with \"Gizmo\" . It is case sensitive, so make sure you capitalize Gizmo or Group. Removed all x and y node graph positions from the gizmos, (xpos and ypos). If you leave these in; when you have a node selected and create a gizmo, instead of spawning under the node, it can fly to the part of the node graph where the x and y positions were stored at. Removed all Nuke Version lines from the gizmos to avoid annoying errors about different versions. Most of these tools were tested using Nuke 11.3v4, but that does not mean they require that version. Some gizmos were created for different versions, so please use the links provided to see what versions the tools are compatible with if something is not working. Tried consolidating the types of channels the gizmos might be bringing into your scripts by making sure they are using the same types of channel names. For example, all Position World pass channels will come in as P.red, P.green, P.blue, P.alpha , and all Normals World pass channels will come in as N.red, N.green, N.blue, N.alpha . There are a few exceptions where some tools are using unique channel names, but for the most part they are always using .red, .green, .blue, .alpha, .u, or .v at the end of the channels. Most channel/layer names are kept as the original tool had them. For example apChroma, hag_pos, despill, etc. Added an Author Tag to the end of all Gizmos in the menu. NKPD just stands for Nukepedia, where I did not make a custom tag if there weren't many tools from this author. These might help in 2 ways: To filter for certain tools if you want to search by all of Adrian Pueyo\u2019s AP tools or Mark Joey Tang\u2019s MJT tools using nuke\u2019s tab search. Will also help you identify who made what, and make it easier to find in the Tool Documentation To help identify that this gizmo is from the Nuke Survival Toolkit, in case there are duplicate tools in the pipeline loaded with the same name. Dealing with Hard Coded filepaths on Gizmo Creation There is a function, filepathCreateNode() , stored in the NST_helper.py file, that first detects if the Group/Gizmo being created has a Read, DeepRead, ReadGeo, Camera, Axis . Then, if the file knob in the node contains the string <<<replace>>> in the filepath, this will be replaced by the location where the NukeSurvivalToolkit is stored. This means for templates, example scripts, and occasional gizmos that require image files, They will be created with hardcoded links pointing to images in the Nuke Survival Toolkit. This was necessary because if I manually hardcoded the filepath, it will error because it does not know where your NST image is. If you use a live variable, similar to [root.name] to try and point to the NST, it will work for you and anyone with the same NST installed, but not if you try and render on a renderfarm without the NST installed or pass the script to the artist without the NST installed, as nuke won\u2019t find the variable and won\u2019t know where to point to. Replacing the variable and hard coding the filepath on creation is the best way to make sure the tool to work with anyone opening the script, as long as the Nuke Survival Toolkit does not move locations, or the image file is not moved, deleted, renamed, etc","title":"Tech Specs"},{"location":"techSpecs.html#technical-details","text":"There are a few things about this menu that try and make it both easy and safe to use.

Features: Grab Title: Will try and grab either the nearest stamp name, from the matte stream, or else a read node name if it finds a read node. Hopefully if you are using a pipeline, and stamps, and have configured stamps to default to part of the name of a read node to use as the name (you can adjust this in the stamps_config.py file) then it will run the same function to find the 'right' name to use and fill in the \"New Channel Name\" text input.

New Range Change the range of an Animation Curve. For example, if min and max values are -5 and 6, you can project all the curve in the new frame range -5 and 20. Drag and Drop your curve in the knob Input and use the button to find out the min and max value, then insert your new values and check in the Curve Editor your new curve. 3. Smooth Curves Smooth the curve with this tool. Insert your curve in the knob Input, select the Type (High or Low) and the power of the smooth. 4. Modify Curves Modify curves with: Translate, Scale and Time Offset. With the checkbox you can activate or not the modifiers. 5. Fade Create the fade/dissolve from start frame till end frame. Animate mix or another knob from 0-1 or 1-0. Types: - Linear - Slow-in Slow-out - Slow-in Linear-out - Linear-in Slow-out Based on David Ozols' tutorial 6. Reference Frame Set a reference frame. This means your curve will be set to 0 in that frame. Basically it will be translated to 0 in the Reference Frame. 7. Percentage Increase or Decrease the curve by a X percentage. 8.

You can set the pivot of the scale point to either center, min, or max, depending on how you want your curve to scale. Frequency: Scales the curve in the X axis, and pivot frame serves as the pivot point for the X axis scale, so if you set to frame 1050 and scale the frequency, frame 1050 will remain the same value and scale outward from there. Position X and Position Y: Simple controls to move the curve up and down and left and right on the curve editor. Advanced Usage You can sort of 'stack' or drive multiple curves by expression linking another curve/randomizer into the Position Y, amplitude, or frequency knobs, or by manually animating them. You can achieve some pretty dynamic results. Squarify option: Makes random and noise steppy, and includes a random seed button.

A great article is written about this method from Boris MC: http://boris-mc.com/?p=2700 There is also a nice video explaining the workflow: https://vimeo.com/429161580 This workflow can often get chaotic quite quickly with lots of objects holding out each other. How It Works This tool aims to speed up and simplify this workflow even further. It creates a new layer with the alpha channel of the element and a custom name. Using additional channels and deepMerging all of the elements together into 1 big scene, you can later pull out the mattes from each individual element, giving you the matte of that element, held out by all other elements in the scene. This is a custom holdout matte for that object. The goal would be to prerender just 1 render with all channels, and simply shuffle out the deep holdout mattes for any element you need. Features Grab Title button: Uses functions from Adrian Pueyo's stamps plugin to try and predict the layername from the deep input Prefix/Postfix options: Add \"ID\" prefix for \"ID_newLayer\" or \"matte\" postfix for \"newLayer_matte\" Inject New Channel: Click to inject - the node's text will turn red and label will change Reset: Restore default state of the node Target Input Alpha: Use if your alpha from color input is different than the alpha from deep input All channels are just a single .red channel to save time during the deep merge process, since each layer and each channel must be calculated.","title":"DeepRecolorMatte"},{"location":"deep/deeprecolormatte.html#deeprecolormatte-tl","text":"Author: Tony Lyons - http://www.CompositingMentor.com There is a popular deep workflow used in production where you deep combine many elements together, and have to make deepHoldouts for each layer, usually pre-rendering out the alpha channel for each individual layer, to use later, in order to reduce heaviness.

Create an arbitrary number of color-samples in 2D and produce a smooth, natural interpolation over the entire image. The Gizmo uses Natural Neigbor Interpolation to calculate the pixels inbetween samples, using Blinkscripts. You can also output the underlying Voronoi Diagram or play with the smoothness value to control the amount of the softening (0 = Voronoi Diagram, 1 = Accurate Natural Neighbor Interpolation). Another important function is the ability to sample input colors, instead of defining them yourself. Setting the Type to 'Sample' uses all created points to sample the input colors at given positions. Furthermore you can use the 'Fill' Type to interpolate missing information in any image. A premultiplied input is required for this. Changing the Colorspace will change the color falloff. This can be used to achieve the best artistic result. Setting the Colorspace to HSV for example, will interpolate the colors over the spectrum.

DespillToColor is designed to work best with a specific user defined screen color and therefore a good local solution for certain areas of your plate. Usage: Pick a blue/greenscreen color - set or pick a target color. 'balance' controls how much red tones are being affected by the despill operation opposed to blue and green tones. Increasing the 'gain' will affect a wider range of colors, like the finetune knob in DespillMadness. 'erode' and 'falloff' sometimes work well for increasing the effect in defocussed areas. I usually go for ramping up the 'gain' OR the 'erode', rarely both.

Comes with a few animation presets. Sparky is a pretty clean and simple setup to add sparks in your shot. It is a particle setup that is rendered through a ScanlineRender. The idea is that you can use it like a simple pre-rendered 2D Element coming from your favorite library, but, the main difference being that you can rotate the sparks, and give them the exact orientation you need. This tool is delivered with an example .nk scene to see both 2D and 3D workflows. Features Axis and Cam input: While the main goal is to be a 2D pre-rendered option, you can also select to use a 3D camera to track properly with your shot. In this case, you'll have to plug your Camera and an Axis to move the sparks in the 3D space. Presets: While the look of the particles is very important, the emission rate is definitely a huge part of selling the sparks look. That is why, I decided to add 6 presets that can be loaded from the second tab. These presets will ask you to provide an initial frame and will then apply an animation to the 'Emission Amount' setting. Warning: Presets don't work in Nuke Non-Commercial due to some Python Limitation Preset Types Single Hit Heavy: Heavy hit with a double pop Single Hit Light: Light pop of sparks Welding: Expression that will mimic a natural welding feeling Wavy: Constant sim with some strong variation in birth rate Constant: Softer variation than the Wavy preset Loopy: Loops the same pop animation of Sparks Output As Particles: This will allow you to plug the particles into a Scene node. It will therefore not render any 2D preview anymore. If Sparky doesn't render anything, verify that you didn't check this box by error. Advanced Settings: If you wish to have a wider spread of sparks, or if you decide to animate the Axis to which the sparks are attached, you can access a few settings that may interest you here. The node is deep compatible if you keep it in MultiScanline mode (the default one), but if you want to be 200% sure you are in the right setting, you can check the 'Output Deep' option. While this tool will never replace the real thing, it will definitely be more than enough when chucked in some background scene, or with some DoF or motionblur. Hopefully you will find some use for it and maybe even learn a little bit more about particles.","title":"Sparky"},{"location":"particles/sparky.html#sparky-nkpd","text":"Author: Dimitri Breidenbach http://www.nukepedia.com/gizmos/particles/db_sparky Easy to use particle setup to create sparks.

Other Features: FgMatte input: An optional matte of the foreground can be used which may improve Kronos's motion estimation.

Very simple as it stands, but could be a good example of rebuilding a gizmo's internals using callbacks.","title":"TimeMachine NKPD"},{"location":"transform/index.html","text":"Transform Tools Transformation, warping, stabilization, and 2D/3D projection tools.

Unfortunately, not being able to reliably restore the stabilized image back to the original position meant your rotos and prep work or whatever positioning you were doing was not guaranteed to matchmove back into the original footage. This tool aims to solve this problem and offering a few extra features. Output Choose between stabilize and matchmove Result Modes 3D Projection Setup - This is using 3d nodes, cards and camera projections to guarantee no funkiness and that the stabilize/matchmove process will be reversible. Unfortunately the 3d projection setup will be the slowest option, but it will be a clean preview. card3D setup - This is using the same method as the original imagePlane node, for some reason, this method creates the problem of stabilizing and reversing the movement when matchmoving. It is however very fast because there is no 3D scanline render and calculates as a 2d cornerpin. This will either give you identical or very similar results to the 3D projection setup but is prone to this \"unreversible\" result. Good mode for finding the stabilized distance quickly. Live (Reconcile 3D) - This is by far the fastest calculation for this stabilization process and is recommended for quick previews and finding the stabilization distance. However when using nuke's reconcile 3D node with live points, it gets very buggy. Some frames are black, other frames 'explode' and seem to lose the 3d points for reference. Proxy mode or lower resolution preview will be buggy or not work. In theory it should be the exact same result as the 3d Projection setup, so the stabilization/matchmove workflow is intact, but it's very buggy, especially when rendering. Do not leave on this live mode, purely use it as a quick preview to find the stabilization distance and ensure accuracy. Baked (Cornerpin) - When you bake the framerange, it will switch to this mode in order to save calculation time, and to eliminate the bugginess of the stabilization/matchmove workflow from the \"live\" previews. Controls Status: Will tell you the status of the node, whether it is Live or baked (and what framerange) Ref Frame: This frame is the stabilization pivot frame of the stabilization/matchmove and will be unaffected / have zero transformations Distance from Cam: This number is the distance from camera in nuke units to place the stabilization card. Sometimes you roughly know the distance from the camera that the object you are trying to stabilize is, and other times you can just eyeball distance by moving away from your reference frame in the timeline and changing the distance until object remains in the same position in the screen as it was in the reference frame. Bake FrameRange: This will create a baked cornerpin based off the ref frame and distance from camera. It's recommended to run this once you are happy with your stabilization result because it will not only be less prone to nuke's bugginess from the other live setups but it will also be a lot faster since it is baked and not calculating anything live with expressions or 3D setups. Clear baked: Clears the keyframes and reverts the node back to live. Sets to default. Export Baked Track / Export Linked Track: These 2 buttons are acting like the export cornerpin button in nuke's 2d Tracker node. They will export a cornerpin node that is stabilized or matchmoved (depending on the output you have selected). Overscan: A simple setting to manage your bbox and set an overscan allowance (in pixels). Motion Blur: Ability to add motionblur for your matchmove result based on either samples on the scanline render or motion blur knob on the card3D or cornerpin node.","title":"ImagePlane3D"},{"location":"transform/image-plane-3d.html#imageplane3d-tl","text":"Author: Tony Lyons - https://www.CompositingMentor.com The original imagePlane node seems to have a problem with stabilizing the image, and then reverting the stabilized image back to the original position by matchmoving.

(e.g. ParticleBlinkscriptRender will give you error if pulled out on Nuke12.0 or below) After updating the menu, select any nodes in the menu, and click 'create node' to pull it out You can also 'add to favorite'.

There are a lot of nodes that already exist in Nuke's UI menu, so there's a filter function. The duplicated classes will not show up in this tool - only those with multiple versions and hidden ones. Examples 4 different versions of 'Tracking' (many people like to stick with the old one) 2 versions of LensDistortion (the old one is often preferred) Hidden nodes like 'ParticleToImage' You can edit the filter manually and detect file types.

This is convenient because we have some great tools to define areas in 2D: Roto and Rotopaint, as well as a great tool to do 2D mapping: STMap. The Concept Since we're in 2D, we can now use 2 channels as our 2 axes. Which 2 you would like to use is sort of up to you, and based on your specific footage. For chroma keying, two channels that make sense for this approach are the cb and cr channels of the YCbCr colorspace, though Luma and Hue could work, or Hue and Saturation, etc. Basic Implementation The basic implementation is rather simple: 1. Set 2 channels as the STMap input of an STMap node 2. Use a roto as the source Sample Footage This template uses a plate from the Open Source project Tears of Steel, which you can download here: https://media.xiph.org/tearsofsteel/tearsofsteel-footage-exr/02_3c/linear_hd/","title":"STMap Keyer Setup"},{"location":"workflow-templates/stmap-keyer-setup.html#stmap-keyer-setup-el","text":"Author: Erwan Leroy - http://erwanleroy.com/blog/ http://erwanleroy.com/make-a-custom-advanced-keyer-using-stmap/ The idea of this method is to represent the image as a 2D point cloud (vs 1D points or 3D points above) and use some sort of shape to define which area should be transparent or solid, as well as softness.
