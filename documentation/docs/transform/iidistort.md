Recursive IDistort, produces similar results as Substance Designer's Vector Warp/Morph.

Built with Blinkscript, this is a very easy kernel to breakdown for beginners. The code is almost identical to Mads Hagbarth Damsbo's example code in his [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Lv7ThKbUk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Lv7ThKbUk).

I find the distortions created from it sometimes more interesting than from a regular IDistort. The tool will be included with the Nuke Vector Matrix toolset.
