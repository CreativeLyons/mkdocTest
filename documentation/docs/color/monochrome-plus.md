Monochome workflows are a great standard for doing channel difference based operations (e.g. removing tracking markers)
Monochrome Plus provides a couple of extra features to make the workflow faster.

**Features:**
- **Weight** - controls each channel's contribution to the final monochromatic channel
- **Source/Target** - allows the user to divide/multiply the monochromatic channel
- **Use weighted target as source** - replaces the source values with a weighted multiply to allow colour matching with one colour pick
