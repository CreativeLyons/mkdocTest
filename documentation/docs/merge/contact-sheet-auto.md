Full Credit goes to Ben McEwan and his very detailed blog post about powering up your contact sheets: [https://benmcewan.com/blog/2018/08/26/power-up-your-contact-sheets/](https://benmcewan.com/blog/2018/08/26/power-up-your-contact-sheets/)
The python script to change your knob defaults on the normal contactSheet node in your menu.py file is already here, posted by Ben: [http://www.nukepedia.com/python/misc/autocontactsheet](http://www.nukepedia.com/python/misc/autocontactsheet)
This one is just for people who want to download the expressioned node and add it to their toolsets and not mess with any menu.py files.
