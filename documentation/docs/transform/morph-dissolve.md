Allows to morph between two moving plates automatically, or can be used to improve manual Morphs. Inspired by Avid Fluid Morph or Adobe's Morph Cut.

Will work best on visually similar plates or for invisible jump cuts. The more different the two plates to morph, the more artefacts will be present.

Can be used to improve manual Morphs (splineWarp or Gridwarp) by feeding the distorted A in one input and the distorted B in the other input. The Morph_Dissolve will look for the small details you may have missed or ignored with your manual morph.
