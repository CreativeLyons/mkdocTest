A 2D based Relighting tool to help relight 3D renders with help of a normals pass.

All you need is to feed it with a normals pass through the Normals input.

Use the 'mask' input to isolate a specific object in your scene.
### Features
- Antialias normals to get rid of flickering
- Use ReNorm if your normals are coded from 0 to 1 instead of -1 to 1
