Spotflare is a procedural flare generator, that generates a general radial light but also allow for light shimmer and "cone" masking.

At the core of spotflare is a radial light, that is generated from the inverse square of the distance to the center. Unlike a liniear falloff, a inverse square falloff gives a very realistic light look.

If you look at the diffrence between a gaussian and a gamma adjusted inverse square profile you can clearly see the effect.
