GodRaysProjector is a 3D alternative to the generally 2D Godrays node. By connecting a renderCamera, projectionCamera and an image to project. Thanks to the wonders of BlinkScript it also has a wicked-fast GPU preview!

I decided to completely rebuild GodRaysProjector and clean up a lot of the bugs and quirks. This also gave me a chance to make the code super-readable for people who are starting out with Blinkscript and want some easy to read examples.

The biggest feature of this update is the shadow functionality, this uses a couple neat tricks to produce a 2D shadow solution, with the information we'd generally have for a shot.
